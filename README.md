Welcome to Phase 1, where we'll be learning the ins and outs of the JavaScript programming language!

We'll emphasize the DOM tree, accessing and modifying it using event listeners and other cool elements.

We'll also introduce Git/GitHub, two essential tools in any software engineer's arsenal.

Be sure to clone down this repo so that you are able to commit and push changes to it, as that way you can save your progress as we work together to learn JavaScript, frontend programming, debugging techniques, and more!
